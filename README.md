ðŸ’¬ About Me
# Hi there, I'm Varun Pratap Singh ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate web developer with a strong front-end and back-end technologies foundation. My journey in web development began when I was pursuing a B.Tech(Computer Science). Since then, I've been on an exciting and ever-evolving adventure of creating beautiful, user-friendly web experiences.


## ðŸš€ What I Do

Front-End Development: I craft responsive, pixel-perfect user interfaces. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are my daily companions, and I'm a big fan of modern frameworks like React.js.

Back-End Development: I'm not just about making things look good; I also enjoy working under the hood. I'm proficient in Node.js .java. to build robust and scalable server-side applications.

Database Management: Databases are the heart of any dynamic web application. I'm experienced in designing and optimizing databases using MySQL and MongoDB.

Version Control: Collaboration and code management are essential. I'm well-versed in using Git and GitHub for seamless version control and team collaboration.
